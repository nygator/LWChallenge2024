# LWChallenge2024
This is my entry to the lauriewired 2024 captcha challenge

To run this captcha, just run the index.html on your browser of choice. It uses webgl, but it runs well on my laptop with Ryzen 3 and iGPU.
I hope no-one takes this too seriously :D

Some effects loop nicely, like if you don't know the answer to some hard question or the greetings you get if you manage to pass the test.
